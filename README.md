## Overview
The Investment React Project is a web application built with React to help users simulate and visualize their investment growth over time. This project highlights React's dynamic capabilities and demonstrates the use of components, state management, and data visualization techniques.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays results with real-time updates as inputs change.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and minimalistic design for seamless interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: CSS/TailwindCSS (if applicable)
- **Charting Library**: [e.g., Chart.js or Recharts, if used]
